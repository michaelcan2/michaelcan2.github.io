<p>I am a current graduate student at the Northwestern University Artificial Intelligence program who is passionate about data analytics.  </p>

<p>My studies at Northwestern include utilizing various types of data processing software such as Spark, Tableau, and Tensorflow. For example, I have used these techniques to dissect data sets on all the settlements with the Chicago Police Department. My team and I used the discovered data patterns to connect commonalities among violent interactions with the police force. I have also analyzed the success of theatrical plays at one of Chicagoâ€™s premier theatres. The goal was to anticipate the success of a show prior to investing in its production and to maximize revenue using the listed performance dates and number of tickets sold.</p>

<p>Studying Artificial Intelligence at Northwestern has taught me several skills such as competitive analysis, strategic investigation, problem solving, meeting deadlines, teamwork, and delivering effective presentations.  I am eager to put these skills to work in a professional environment and feel that I would be a great addition to the Wex team.
